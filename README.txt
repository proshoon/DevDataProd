This is the README file for the Shiny app created as part of Week 4 assigment at Coursera Developing Data Products course.

The app is hosted at https://proshoon.shinyapps.io/DevDataProd

The app consists of two files: ui.R and server.R

Both these files are at the same git repository as this file. These two files can be deployed locally (on RStudio) to run a local instance of the application (if necessary), for reproducibility purposes.

The behavior of the app:

The front-end UI essentially allows the user to select the number of cylinders.
A picklist is provided, with three possible values (4, 6, and 8).
The default option is 4 and the system shows a histogram visualizing mpg data for cars with 4 cylinders.
The user can now choose any one of the three options and the system shows the corresponding histogram.
At the end, the user can simply exit out of the application.
